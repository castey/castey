# Hello üëã

Hi, my name is **David Castro**. I am a 3rd-year computer science student earning a **Bachelor of Science (BSCS)** at [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu) with a minor in psychology.

President of the [Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers](https://wright.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/society-of-hispanic-professional-engineers) at Wright State and Treasurer of a new student organization, the Wright State Chess Club

## Fall Semester Projects 

### KastleLab Projects

Projects related to the [Knowledge and Semantic Technologies Laboratory](https://kastle.cs.wright.edu/) at Wright State University. 

- [Representing knowledge graph entities and outputting a knowledge graph of that processed representation.](https://github.com/castey/CodeForKastle/windower)

- [Downloading scientific papers programmatically from various publications.](https://github.com/castey/CodeForKastle/paper-scraper)

### Extracurriculars
- [Project to turn the stairs in the atrium of the Russ Engineering Building into a piano staircase.](https://github.com/BoffinFactory/PianoStaircase)

## Past Projects:

### üî¨ [Independent Study Project Investigating drift in knowledge graph embeddings](https://github.com/castey/KGE-IS) 
Measured embedding drift between triples, using TransE with a fixed seed for reproducibility, on the FB15k-237, FB15k-238, and FB15k-239 datasets. Generated plots and visualizations using pyplot, t-SNE, and UMAP.

### ü§ñ [Facebook bot](https://github.com/castey/facebook-chat-bot)
Created this a few years ago using node.js and openai. Based an a private fork of the [Unofficial Facebook Chat API](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api) with mission critical fixes by [robertlockesoftware](https://github.com/robertlockesoftware). 

### üíª [RAG bot using semantic embeddings and GPT-4](https://github.com/castey/ragBot)

Uses embeddings and cosine similarity to operate as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model on top of GPT4, making it capable of having long term memory outside of its given context window. The retrieval is done just by interactng with a mysql database and brute forcing the cosine similarity comparisons. Embeddings are done with [TensorFlow Universal Sentence Encoder](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/universal-sentence-encoder). 

### üõ†Ô∏è An Arduino robot
Learned some fundamentals of arduinos
