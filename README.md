## Hi there! 👋

Hello, my name is **David Castro**. I am a Junior studying **Computer Science** at [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu).

Two projects I am working on this semester are:

- 🤖 **A Facebook bot** I created a few years ago and have been adding to ever since - I need to rewrite it because it was very badly thrown together and it's getting harder and harder to maintain.

- 🛠️ **An Arduino robot** that I'm gonna connect to OpenAI's API.
